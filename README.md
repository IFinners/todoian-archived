# Todoian

## A Task Manager With A Simple Design And Surprising Depth

Todoian lacks a GUI but doesn't lack much in terms of features with simple, intuitive commands allowing you to take control of not only your Tasks but your longer term Goals as well.

### Some of the more notable features include:

- Chronological organisation of Tasks means a quick glance is enough to ascertain what you should have already done, what you need to do today and what awaits you in the future

- Display as much or as little as you want with commands ranging from viewing a single Goal to viewing all overdue, due today and future tasks

-  Break down Tasks and Goals into more managable chunks or clearer steps with Subitems

-  Track your progress towards a Goal's completion with a progress      bar that can be set manually or calculated automatically from your Subgoal completion

-  Add highly customisable repeats to your Tasks

-  Tag Tasks and Goals with an unlimited number of keywords
